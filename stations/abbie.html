        <h1 class="station-name">SPF99</h1>

        <p class="station-description">SPF 99 Radio is the ultimate nostalgic soundtrack for a sunny, carefree
            afternoon. Dedicated to spinning hits from before the 2000s, this station is a time capsule of feel-good
            anthems, summer classics, and deep-cut gems that transport listeners to a world before streaming and
            smartphones. True to its name, SPF 99 Radio isn’t just about music—it’s a call to step outside, soak up the
            world beyond screens, and embrace the moment. At the heart of its ethos is Baz Luhrmann’s Everybody’s Free
            (To Wear Sunscreen) speech, a recurring reminder to live fully, protect your skin, and savor life’s simple
            joys. Whether you’re driving with the windows down, lounging in the park, or just dreaming of golden-hour
            adventures, SPF 99 Radio keeps the vibe timeless and the energy endless. Put on SPF 99 Radio and soak up the
            sun.</p>
