    UTK SCHOOL OF DESIGN SPRING 2025<br><br>
  </span>

  <span style="width: 75%; text-align: left; margin-left: 10%;">
    In this experimental media studio, we will explore transmission and reception through a variety of graphic forms,
    materials, and technologies. In particular, a goal of the class will be operating a DIY radio station within the
    A+A. How might text and images express the sonic identity of a radio wave meant to be heard not seen? What happens
    when graphics are designed to be transmitted via sonic patterns? How can visible and invisible design work in tandem
    to communicate a message?
    <br><br>
    Using the concept of broadcasting as a framework, students will design both physical (fliers, posters, and beyond)
    and invisible (radio broadcasts, sound design, and performance) media that engage with and complicate the act of
    communicating, while thinking critically about the importance of medium and message in their work. We will research
    and pull inspiration from moments of intervention and subversion in public communication, with a special focus on
    underground, freeform, alternative, guerrilla, and pirate forms.
